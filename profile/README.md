## USB Safely Remove Crack

USB Safely Remove 7.0.5.1320 places an icon in the system tray and automatically detects USB drives already connected to your PC. Hovering over this icon displays device names and their current status. Unlike Windows, which doesn’t allow you to hide a device you want to eject from the menu, this software prevents such issues by providing a unique and versatile context menu that shows real device names. With this feature, you can easily locate and safely eject a device with just a click!
